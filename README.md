## Dolores Landingham Bot

![Dolores](http://seattletimes.nwsource.com/ABPub/2006/05/11/2002987603.jpg)

This is a Slack bot that helps onboard new hires at 18F through scheduled Slack
messages about topics relevant to 18F and GSA employees. Messages will be
scheduled once per day and will trickle out to employees over the course of 60
days.

Mrs. Landingham will teach 18F employees about working in the federal
government, how to set up travel, how to add their biographical information and
pictures to our website, and other facts that will help them get acclimated to
both 18F and the federal government.

Please file an issue if you have any questions about Mrs. Landingham.
